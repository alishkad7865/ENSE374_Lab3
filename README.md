*This is  my Login/ SignUp and To-do List Page*

I tried to create a replica of your pages exactly. It got annoying after a while as It was very time consuming.
Changes :
1. I added a little copyright symbol and date at bottom of Login page, as it was good to have a footer
2. The checkdown box is different and small
3. It removes all the checked elements (changes static lists too)
4. Used Java script as well as Jquery
